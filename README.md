# React Query Learning

This repository is dedicated to my React Query learning journey. It's a hands-on approach to understanding React Query, a library that allows you to make requests and handle response metadata. To make a query, define a unique key and an asynchronous function to resolve data, as parameters of useQuery. This project was inspired by one YouTube video.
